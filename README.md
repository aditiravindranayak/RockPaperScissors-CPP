**Description:**

This repository contains a console-based implementation of the classic game "Rock, Paper, Scissors" using C++. The game allows a user to play against the computer in a series of rounds. It randomly generates the computer's choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) and compares it with the user's input. The program then determines the winner for each round based on the traditional rules: Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beat Paper, and Paper beats Rock.

**Features:**

- Simple and intuitive console interface.
- Random selection of the computer's choice using C++'s standard library.
- Clear output of each round's result (Win, Lose, or Tie).
- Educational resource for beginners learning C++ basics such as functions, conditional statements, and user input handling.
- Easily extensible for additional features such as keeping score across multiple rounds or adding a graphical user interface.

**Usage:**

To play the game:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the `rock_paper_scissors.cpp` file using a C++ compiler.
3. Run the compiled executable.
4. Follow the prompts to enter your choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) and see the results.
